## Dynamic Ambulance Dispatch System (DADS)

This project is a Dynamic Ambulance Dispatch System designed to efficiently allocate ambulance resources during emergencies and facilitate patient admissions to hospitals based on various factors such as casualties, road conditions, and patient details.

The main objectives of this system are:

1. Emergency Response Optimization: To swiftly identify the nearest hospital to an emergency location, considering factors like road conditions and casualties.

2. Patient Admission Management: To manage patient admissions to hospitals based on their proximity, available resources, and severity of their condition.

3. Efficient Resource Allocation: To optimize the allocation of ambulance resources by determining the shortest routes and optimal hospitals for patient treatment.

4. Data Management: To maintain a record of patient details, including their name, age, medical history, and contact information, for effective communication and follow-up.

5. User Interface: To provide a user-friendly interface for emergency responders to input emergency details, select hospitals, and manage patient admissions.

The system utilizes graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall to calculate shortest paths and optimal routes between emergency locations and hospitals. It also employs linked lists and file I/O operations for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Overall, this project aims to enhance emergency response efficiency and improve patient care by leveraging technology to streamline ambulance dispatch and hospital admissions processes.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Uses Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute shortest paths between all hospitals.
- **Dynamic Hospital Selection:** Selects the nearest hospital based on ambulance location and hospital capacity.
- **Test Suite:** Includes assert-based C tests for core logic.

---

## File Structure

- `Project_ambu/hospital_final.c` — Main logic for hospital selection and dispatch
- `Project_ambu/test_hospital.c` — Unit tests for shortest path and selection logic
- `Project_ambu/hospital_names.txt` — List of hospitals
- `Project_ambu/weights.txt` — Distance matrix between hospitals
- `Project_ambu/patient_details.txt` — Simulated patient data
- `Project_ambu/casualtiesMatrix.txt` — Matrix of casualties (if applicable)

---

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Compile the Project

```bash
gcc Project_ambu/hospital_final.c -o Project_ambu/hospital_final.exe
```

### 2. Run the Main Program

```bash
./Project_ambu/hospital_final.exe
```

### 3. Run the Tests

```bash
gcc Project_ambu/test_hospital.c -o Project_ambu/test_hospital
./Project_ambu/test_hospital
```

## How It Works

1. **Ambulance Receives Emergency Call:**
   - The system identifies the ambulance's current location.
2. **Patient Details Collected:**
   - Information such as severity, location, and requirements are gathered.
3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The system calculates the shortest path from the ambulance to all hospitals using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
4. **Hospital Selection:**
   - The nearest hospital with available capacity is selected.
5. **Ambulance Dispatched:**
   - The ambulance is routed to the selected hospital.
